# Portfolio

## Portfolio for Challenge #2
* Tried to follow the mock-up, added basic HTML outline: Head, Body, Header, Sections & Div.
* Added Flexbox elements with CSS in order to recreate the mock-up as closely as possible.
* Added basic media queries (didn't quite work right)
 
 ## Will most likely resubmit for a better grade once I get the bugs situated and fixed!
 Sorry for the mess!
